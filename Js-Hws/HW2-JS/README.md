# HW 2
## Provide a few examples of when it is appropriate to use the **try...catch** construct in code.

- Using the *try...catch* construct can help to handle any errors that may happen and prevent the code from damage.
    - We can use in asynchronous code - We handle the asynchronous code by using callbacks,promises however an error may occur during the execution of the code. *try...catch* construct can help to handle these errors.
    - We can use in Debugging - we can wrap specific sections of code with *try...catch*  to catch and log any errors that occur.
    - When working with external resources - When working with external resources such as files, databases, or APIs, there is always a chance that something may go wrong. *try...catch* construct can help to handle these errors.
