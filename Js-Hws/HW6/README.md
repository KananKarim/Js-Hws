## Explain in your own words how you understand the concept of *asynchronous* programming in JavaScript.

- Asynchronous programming in JavaScript is a way to do things in the background while the rest of your code keeps running.

- By the helping of Asynchronous we can do:
    - Let's imagine that we have a task that might take a while, as getting information from a website, we can start that task and then let our code do other things while it waits for the information to come back. When the information is ready, our code can pick up where it left off and use that information.
